# Car-Purchasing-Amount-Model
The goal of this project was to predict the amount a particular customer can purchase a Car , given information like the customer's Age , Gender , Annual Salary ,Net worth and Credit card debt, I performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset firstly and from the analysis I gained the following insights. -There is a balance between the number of males and number of females in the dataset , no bias in gender.(0=male , 1=female) -There is a linear relationship between the car purchase amount and the annual salary , both features are highly positively  correlated , Customers with higher salary are likely to spend more when purchasing a car.  I also checked the correlation between the target variable(car purchase amount) and other features by plotting a heatmap.  I made use of a simple linear Regression model because of the strong linear relationship between the target variable and the independent features,   Source of dataset : Kaggle
